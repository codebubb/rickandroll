      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        You can generate a short URL to send to your friends; they'll be redirected to a Rick Roll video of your choice and then you can view stats of where it was accessed from!
        <ul>
          <li>Generate a short URL using the form above.</li>
          <li>Forward the disguised, short url link to your colleagues by whatever means you can.</li>
          <li>View the stats by adding <em>/viewstats</em> to the end of your short URL ! (for example <em>https://51w.site/7pdgUd/viewstats</em>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You can generate as many short URLs as you like.</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        This is a simple URL shortener app that was made as part of a full,
        end-to-end project on the
        <a href="https://youtube.com/juniordevelopercentral"
          >Junior Developer Central</a
        >
        YouTube channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although its a simple app, the idea of the project was to create
        something from scratch going through all the processes involved in a
        project from the design, to purchasing the domain(s) and hosting and
        configuring a build pipeline to automatically build and push the built
        code to a production server.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst there are many different (and easier!) ways of setting up an
        environment like this, the idea of the granular tutorials is to go in
        depth with all the details of how it might be done with the available
        tools and then you can decide to replace any parts of the system if you
        find a different way of doing something.
